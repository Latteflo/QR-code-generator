# QR-code-generator
This is a small project that involves generating QR codes using the npm library, JS, CSS and HTML.
The process was fairly straightforward and I was able to get the desired results with minimal effort.

Overall, I found this project to be a great way to learn more about QR code generation and how it can be used in various applications.
